THINGS TO GET DONE:

1. New students can't view stats, figure out why

2. Have a check for duplicate questions (based on is_active and question text) that if there is a duplicate question will redirect the 
    user to that question's edit page

3. Can't use quotes "" in edit/add questions (the inputting into Database won't allow it)
    You're going to need to use either double quotes ( ""test"" -> "test",  ''test'' -> 'test')
    OR use backslashes, which is probably the better way to do it (  \"test )
